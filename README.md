# Intrinsic Safety Verification Tool (IEC 60079-14)

This Excel-based tool helps EC&I engineers verify compliance with IEC 60079-14 for intrinsically safe (Ex i) circuits. It is intended for linear systems with a single power source (e.g., isolator) and up to three field devices.

### ✅ Features
- Compares entity parameters (U, I, P, L, C)
- Automatically checks compliance with IEC 60079-14
- Applies 1.5x safety factors for Group IIC circuits
- Visual pass/fail feedback and embedded macros
